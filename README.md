# Shallow Crimson Chess Engine
### C++ and AI/ML chess engine made by Chaidhat Chaimongkol
### Started on 26 December, 2020.

### Promises
-   100 percent my code - not copied from anywhere
-   I will not closely examine Stockfish or any other engine's code
-   No book moves were used which weren't calculated by the engine.
